Good for demoing:
- (!) interactivity (inputs)
- figure out a chart construction solution
  * that doesnt suck
  * (to go straight from sql query to view)
- hot keys (need to have cell focus variable and visual)
  * submit
  * switch modes
  * commenting
  * autocomplete? (nice to have)
- plan a ui for
  * split notebook experience
  * viewer experience
  * discovery
 
Necessary:
- save files (as .ipynb)
  * github right away? flat files?
  * if committing, we'll have to distinguish
   between your dirty version and the clean version
   end users see
- multiple rooms, multiple kernels
- restarting kernels
- permalink
- better cursor visibility
  * and show cursor in other clients

Additional features?
- add native sql support?
  * extra modes for the top cell
    - database explorer?
- add commenting?
- authentication? organizations?
- add your own requirements.txt
- add stylesheet
- better real time support (csrd?)
  * at least make sure we have a timestamp on updates
- scheduler
- expose an api (deploy models off this system)
